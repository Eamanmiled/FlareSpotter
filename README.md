# Flare Detection using OpenCV & Tkinter

This is a computer vision project that detects bright light sources (I am focusing on Jet flares) in images and videos using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. It applies grayscale conversion, binary thresholding, and contour detection to locate and highlight flares with red rectangles.

## Features

- Detects bright spots (flares) in **static images**
- Processes **video files** frame-by-frame in real-time
- Tkinter GUI using **Tkinter** to select preloaded images or upload custom files
- Supports **image** and **video** file uploads
